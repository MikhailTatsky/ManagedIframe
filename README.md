ManagedIframe
=============

A power-packed series of Javascript classes for managing IFRAMEs for Sencha products.

Note: Effective Ext 4, ManagedIframe releases will be linked with the similar versioning strategy.

MIF \< 4.1 (1.\*, 2.\*)
-------------
Legacy releases of the ManagedIframe series have NOT YET been moved here from code.google a this time.
Versions 1.\* and 2.\* will be migrated to GIT from code.google during this process.

MIF 4.1
-------------
The release that WILL NEVER BE.

MIF 4.2 Alpha1 (For Ext 4.2.*)
-------------

New stuff: ( SEAMLESS Emulation and Frame event bubbling )!

 * cross-frame 'postMessage' emulation (for legacy browsers)
 * 'seamless' emulation (for legacy browsers)
 * full frame-document-event-bubbling (\*click, mouse\*, touch\*') events
 
Ext release 4.2 has created a unique 'packaging' opportunity for Component development.  Products such
as Sencha Architect will be using this mechanism to import external modular packages for use during UI
design.  As such, ManagedIframe classes will be easier to get, import, customize, and build (Sencha 
Command 3.1.2+ required).
