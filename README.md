New stuff: ( SEAMLESS Emulation and Frame event bubbling )!

 * cross-frame 'postMessage' emulation (for HTML5 and legacy browsers, same-origin only)
 * 'seamless' emulation (for HTML5 and legacy browsers, same-origin only)
 * full frame-document-event-bubbling (\*click, mouse\* ) events. Define only the ones you
are interested in, available to your Controllers, and every thing you need for drag-drop.  ;)
 
ManagedIframe is now implemented as a Sencha Command package for Ext release 4.2.   

Products such
as Sencha Architect will be using this mechanism to import external modular packages for use during UI
design.  As such, ManagedIframe classes will be easier to get, import, customize, and build (Sencha 
Command 3.1.2+ required).
